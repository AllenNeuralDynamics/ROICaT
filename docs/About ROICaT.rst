About ROICaT
============
Region Of Interest Classification and Tracking 

A simple-to-use Python package for classifying images of cells and tracking them across imaging sessions/planes. 
Currently designed to be used with Suite2p output data (stat.npy and ops.npy files) and CaImAn output data (results.h5 files), but any image data can be used.

With this package, you can:

* Classify cells into different categories (e.g. neurons, glia, etc.) using a simple GUI.
* Track cells across imaging sessions/planes using a jupyter notebook or script.
* We have found that ROICaT is capable of classifying cells with accuracy comparable to human relabeling performance, and tracking cells with higher accuracy than any other methods we have tried.
